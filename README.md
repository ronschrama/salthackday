# salthackday
One day hackathon in which I had to create a individual project.
This project had to contain a frontend and a backend and request information from an API.

# My Project
For this hackday I created a website with React and used Express for the routing and API data fetching. It is a website that fetches data from a specific list of Marvel hero's from the Marvel API
